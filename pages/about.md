The Tardif lab develops quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to investigate brain tissue microstructure in vivo. We primarily use these techniques to study myelination in healthy individuals, as well as in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Please consult our projects and publications for more detailed information.
